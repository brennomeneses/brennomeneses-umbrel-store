  Coder enables organizations to set up development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. 
  Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed Wireguard® tunnel, and automatically shut down when not used to save on costs. 
  Coder gives engineering teams the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads most beneficial to them.
